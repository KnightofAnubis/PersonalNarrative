===start_here===
It had been awhile since that strange voice whispered in your ear. In the end everything worked out and you were able to get back to a normal sleep schedule that did wonders for your grades. Today is the last day of the semester before Winter break and while you feel a slight tightness in your chest, overall you feel fine with the encroaching final. 
You head for school with a smile on your face. While you still feel the panic and anxiety caused by that strange voice, you no longer hear it whispering in your ear.
